# Movie App

## Description

For this project, we were to grab movies from the database and display them on the home page.  When a movie is clicked, that click would dispatch to get the movie details, as well as take the user to the /details page.  On the details page you can find only the details of the specific movie you clicked on.  There is also the ability to edit a movie title and description which, when saved, gets updated in the database.  The ultimate goal of this project was to utilize everything we have learned so far.  Things like etting information to and from the databasea and using reducers to transfer data between components.
